# The-Climate-Policy-Simulation-Agent---Capstone-Project
 I will build the ECHO Agent (Environmental Chain of Outcomes), a multi-agent system using ADK Python. It orchestrates sub-agents for real-time data retrieval, local $\text{CO}_2$ modeling, and synthesis, providing rapid, non-linear risk and benefit analysis for proposed policies.
